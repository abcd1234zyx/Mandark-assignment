In this question, we need to find if proper divisior of sum is equal to number or not
For that, we can iterate over 2 to sqrtofnumber and find all the factors in log(n) complexity
Since, 1 is factor off all numbers,we initialise count with 1
Now, we can add all the factors
and return true if it is equal to number
otherwise, return false.
