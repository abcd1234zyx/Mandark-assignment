In this question, we have to find 
Manhattan distance between starting and end point
For finding that distance we need vertical distance
(whether it is in north or south direction) and
horizontal distance(whether it is east or west direction)
For, that we traverse through string counting north as positiveVertical
and south as negativeVertical(because east and west will have 0
impace on verticalDistance) and same for east as positiveHorizontal and
west as negativeHorizontal and then find the net value by subtracting
respective values and then calculate the square root of square of both
results.
