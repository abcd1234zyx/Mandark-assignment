In this question, we have to find 
1.)Managerand R&D employee
2.)Single Named Employee
For this, we can first open employees file in read mode,manager file and single_name_employee file in write mode and read employee file line by line
Then we can put data in ArrayList(Which is comma seperated)
In that arrayList
1.) For Manager second value in ArrayList should be manager and third value R&D
2.)for Single named Employee in first value of ArrayList, there should be no space.
if condition 1 is true then we will write in manager.csv file and condition 2 is
true then we will paste in single_named_employee.csv file
